# ML-Income-Classifier-Using-UCI-Adult-Data-Set
## Overview
### This project predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 based on demographic and occupational attributes. Using lasso and ridge regression, models are trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing approach.

## Key Features
### Data Preprocessing: Splits data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
### Model Training: Trains lasso and ridge regression models with 10-fold cross-validation to determine the best regularization parameter (Î»).
### Model Evaluation: Evaluates classification accuracy on the testing set and identifies the best model.
